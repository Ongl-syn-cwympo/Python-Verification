# Data Verification ~ verification (is it correct?)

Once we know our data is valid (i.e. it is logical, and in the right format, etc.) then we also need to check if it is correct 
(it maybe a valid date-of-birth, but is it your date-of-birth?!)

# Types of verification

- Proof-reading - the person entering the data simply reads through what they have entered to check it is correct

- Double-entry - the data is entered twice, either by the same, or another operator. The computer compares the data, and any that doesnâ€™t match is questioned.

# Why do we have to have/use a verification type

The purpose of data verification is to ensure that data that are gathered are as accurate as possible, and to minimize human and instrument errors 
including those which arise during data processing.
